Utility to retrieve the Windows host's private IP address from WSL.
This script retrieves the Windows host's private IP address from WSL using the `ip route` command.
It checks if the IP is a private address (10.x.x.x, 172.16.x.x - 172.31.x.x, or 192.168.x.x)
and returns it.
In WSL, the windows host IP is typically the default gateway.

    Retrieves the Windows host's private IP address from within WSL.

    This function executes the `ip route` command in the WSL environment,
    parses its output to find the default gateway's IP address, and then
    validates if this IP address falls within the private IP address ranges.

    Returns:

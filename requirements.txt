# --- Core ML / GPU stack ---
# torch==2.5.1+cu121 # (ensure this matches the version in the Makefile)
# this will not work as part of requirements.txt, since they are not available on PyPI
# instead, use the Makefile to install the correct version of torch or install manually:
# pip install torch==2.7.1 torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128
# OR for older versions:
# pip install torch==2.5.1+cu121 torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121

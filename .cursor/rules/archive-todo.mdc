- Archive when a task group in `docs_AI_coder/product_todo.md` is fully done.
- Steps:
  1) Move the whole group (heading + bullets) to `docs_AI_coder/archived-tasks.md` under `## Archived on YYYY-MM-DD`.
  2) In `product_todo.md`, replace the group with a one-line note: "Archived on YYYY-MM-DD".
  3) Keep original formatting/checkboxes; make minimal diffs.
- Paths and date format must be exact.

- After completing edits, run the project's test command via `shell`.
- On test failures:
  - For first-time failures: Stop and output failure logs (see error-handling rule)
  - For repeated failures after 3 attempts: Revert changes and apply problem-solving approach
- This rule works in sequence with error-handling and problem-solving rules.

- All project context files, for example **AI_instructions.md**, and **product_todo.md** and others, live under the `docs_AI_coder` directory at the project root.
- For example, when you see a reference to `@AI_instructions.md` or `@product_todo.md`, resolve it as: 
@docs_AI_coder/AI_instructions.md
@docs_AI_coder/product_todo.md
- If asked to generate or update **product_todo.md**, write it to `docs_AI_coder/product_todo.md`.
- Use the `@` syntax with the full relative path so that tools like `mcp-search` and file reads target the correct folder.

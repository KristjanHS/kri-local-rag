- All project context files, for example **instructions.md**, **roadmap.md**, and **plan.md** and others, live under the `docs_AI_coder` directory at the project root.
- For example, when you see a reference to `@instructions.md`, `@roadmap.md`, or `@plan.md`, resolve it as: 
@docs_AI_coder/instructions.md
@docs_AI_coder/roadmap.md
@docs_AI_coder/plan.md
- If asked to generate or update **plan.md**, write it to `docs_AI_coder/plan.md`.
- Use the `@` syntax with the full relative path so that tools like `mcp-search` and file reads target the correct folder.

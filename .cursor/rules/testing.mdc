- Write unit tests for your functions and components.
- Ensure your app works as expected with LangChain through integration tests.
- Run tests using `python -m pytest tests/`.
 - Tag tests with pytest markers (see `pyproject.toml` [tool.pytest.ini_options] and `docs_AI_coder/AI_instructions.md` â†’ Testing):
   - Unit: `pytestmark = pytest.mark.unit` in `tests/unit/`
   - Integration: `@pytest.mark.integration` in `tests/integration/`
   - E2E: `@pytest.mark.e2e` (+ `@pytest.mark.slow` if long) in `tests/e2e*`
   - Environment: `@pytest.mark.environment` in `tests/environment/`
 - Default excludes `slow`; include with: `python -m pytest -m slow`

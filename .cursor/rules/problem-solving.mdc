- When trying to solve an error or problem has failed for 3 times:
  1. Review code changes made in this session and create a plan to correct wrong directions
  2. Focus on one top problem and create incremental debugging steps
  3. Add plans to product_todo.md and execute them
- This rule takes precedence over error-handling rules (see `error-handling.mdc`) after 3 failed attempts.
- Sequence: First apply error-handling (stop on failure), then after 3 attempts apply problem-solving (create plan and execute).

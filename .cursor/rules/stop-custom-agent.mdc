- If all required steps are done, emit exactly "<END>" and stop.  
- Do **not** generate any text after "<END>".  
- Use this marker to signal completion; next agent invocation should only run new tasks.
- This rule applies to execution mode agents. For plan mode agents, see `plan-agent-dont-execute.mdc`.

# Rules for Terminal Command Execution

## Environment Context
- **Project Root**: The absolute path to the project root is `/home/kristjans/projects/kri-local-rag`.
- **Terminal Environment**: The Cursor terminal is mostly isolated, but it correctly activates the project's virtual environment.

## Best Practices for Terminal Commands
1.  **Run commands from the project root.** The shell usually starts here, but it's good practice to confirm with `pwd` if you have any doubts.
    <example>
    pwd && some_command
    </example>

2.  **Use the `python` alias.** The shell is configured to use the correct Python interpreter from the project's virtual environment.
    <example>
    python --version
    </example>

3.  **Running Pytest**: To ensure `pytest` can find your project's modules, run it as a module and set the `PYTHONPATH`. This is the most reliable way to avoid `ImportError` issues.
    <example>
    PYTHONPATH=. python -m pytest tests/
    </example>
    <example type="invalid">
    # This may fail if pytest is not in the system PATH or has interpreter issues.
    pytest tests/
    </example>

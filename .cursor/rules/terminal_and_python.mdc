# Rules for Terminal Command Execution

## Environment Context
- **Project Root**: The absolute path to the project root is `/home/kristjans/projects/kri-local-rag`.
- **Terminal Environment**: The Cursor terminal is isolated. It does not reliably inherit shell configurations or `PYTHONPATH`. Do not assume the environment is pre-configured.

## Critical Rules for All Commands
1.  **Always run commands from the project root.** Before executing any command, ensure the working directory is `/home/kristjans/projects/kri-local-rag`.
    <example>
    cd /home/kristjans/projects/kri-local-rag && some_command
    </example>

## Critical Rules for Python Commands
1.  **Use the explicit venv Python interpreter.** Do not use `python` or `python3`. Always use the full path.
    - **Path**: `/home/kristjans/projects/kri-local-rag/.venv/bin/python`

2.  **Running Python Scripts**: Combine the project root and the explicit interpreter path.
    <example>
    cd /home/kristjans/projects/kri-local-rag && /home/kristjans/projects/kri-local-rag/.venv/bin/python backend/some_script.py
    </example>

3.  **Running Pytest**: To ensure imports work correctly, you must set the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable to the project root.
    <example>
    cd /home/kristjans/projects/kri-local-rag && PYTHONPATH=. /home/kristjans/projects/kri-local-rag/.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/
    </example>
    <example type="invalid">
    # This will fail due to import errors.
    pytest tests/
    </example>

- **Run commands from the project root.**
- **Use `.venv/bin/python` for Python execution** to ensure consistent virtual environment usage.
- **Run Pytest as a module:** `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/` to avoid `ImportError` issues.
- **NEVER use PYTHONPATH.** It can break virtual environment detection.

- If a command may invoke a pager or hide output in non-interactive mode (e.g., `git log`, `git diff`), append `| cat` to force full output to the chat/logs.
- When piping to `cat`, prefer preserving the original exit code by running with pipefail, for example:
  - `bash -o pipefail -c 'YOUR_COMMAND | cat'`
  - or `set -o pipefail; YOUR_COMMAND | cat`

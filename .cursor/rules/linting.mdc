- Use Ruff for all Python linting and formatting.
- Ruff runs automatically on save (via the Ruff editor extension) and on commit (via pre-commit).
- CI enforces Ruff (lint and format checks) in PRs.
- Do not manually run Ruff after each edit; rely on the editor and pre-commit. If working headless or fixing CI, use:
  - `ruff check . --fix`
  - `ruff format .`

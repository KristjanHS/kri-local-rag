- Use Ruff for all Python linting and formatting.
- Ruff runs automatically on save and on commit. If working headless or fixing CI, use:
  - `ruff check . --fix`
  - `ruff format .`
- Avoid using `print` (Ruff rule T201). Prefer `logging` for application and tests.
- Use Pyright for static type checking. Use `# type: ignore[...]` sparingly with justification.

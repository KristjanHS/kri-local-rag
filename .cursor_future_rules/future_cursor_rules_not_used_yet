# Coding Style
1. Follow PEP 8 strictly; run `ruff --fix` before every commit.

# Typing & Contracts
2. CI runs `mypy --strict` with no errors.

# Testing
1. Write pytest unit tests for every module; target â‰¥90 % branch coverage.
2. Use `pytest-asyncio` for async code and `hypothesis` for property tests.

# Dependency Management
1. Manage packages with Poetry (or Hatch); pin versions in `pyproject.toml`.
2. Run `pip-audit` on CI to flag vulnerable deps.

# Documentation
1. Use Google-style docstrings; build docs with MkDocs-Material in the `docs/` folder.

# Logging & Observability
1. Replace `print` with `structlog` JSON logs.
2. Expose OpenTelemetry traces; default sample rate 1 %.

# AI Model Handling
1. Store model weights with DVC; never commit binaries to Git.
